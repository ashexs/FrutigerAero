      <link>https://frutigeraero.org/creator_spotlights/august_2025</link>
      <description><![CDATA[This month, our Artist of the Month is HarshnoiseMT! 
<p>Watch the YouTube short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xUYff5EXJ6c" target=_blank>here</a>. </p><br/>
<p>Here's our interview with HarshnoiseMT:</p>
<p class=bold>- Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your background? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>Hi! My name is Megan or HarshnoiseMT. I’m 18 years old and my biggest interests are frutiger metro and chiikawa. I love happy hardcore and dance music. I enjoy doing graphic design and character design related artwork. </p>
<p class=bold>- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>
<p class=quotation-words>I’ve always been passionate about art since I was a child, so art has always been a big thing for me and I have always wanted to be an artist. I have many sketchbooks filled with art I have been making since I was really small. </p>
<p class=bold>- How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and what drew you to it? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>I refound frutiger aero and metro through just scrolling through the internet but specifically frutiger metro stuck out to me the most. I think its because of all the bright colours usually used throughout, which make me very happy! Its also partially because of nostalgia too. </p>
<p class=bold>- How would you describe your art style?</p>
<p class=quotation-words>I would describe it as something that I would like to hope makes you feel happy! </p>
<p class=bold>- Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to finished piece? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>I use pinterest as a lot of my inspiration, I take little bits from other pieces of frutiger metro artwork and make it into my own mash of shapes and colours </p>
<p class=bold>- What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>I use digital most of the time because I guess it's just what I know best for my artwork </p>
<p class=bold>- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>
<p class=quotation-words>I will put my headphones in and listen to a lot of happy hardcore , trance and eurodance music and open pinterest on my phone for some inspiration. I don’t really take long breaks from art as I am an art student! </p>
<p class=bold>- What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or stories you aim to convey? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>My artwork is very heavily inspired by those frutiger metro images you would have seen on a notebook in 2012-2013. As for themes or emotions I would like to convey, I would just like to hope my art makes you happy! </p>
<p class=bold>- Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have influenced your style? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>Cody Vondell’s artwork really inspires me a lot, I love how clean and vibrant his work looks! The frutiger metro style has really influenced my art I really love the fun patterns and colours. </p>
<p class=bold>- What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>I think its the circle patterns, glossy orbs and floral patterns that make my art frutiger metro/aero. </p>
<p class=bold>- What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and why? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>Any piece I have done with glossy shapes that aren't circles are a pain to make, as I have to spend ages to make the gloss on the shapes not look warped! </p>
<p class=bold>- Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s significant to you? </p>
<p class=quotation-words><a title="Artwork 1" class=spotlight href="https://frutigeraero.org/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/august/harshnoisemt_1.png"><img alt="harshnoisemt' Artwork 1" src="https://frutigeraero.org/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/august/thumbnails/harshnoisemt_1.png" loading="lazy"> </a>I love this piece I made so much, I really love the detail I managed to pack into this piece! I also love the colour, pink is my favourite colour. </p>
<p class=bold>- How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced your artistic journey? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>Its really helped me with background design a lot, as my backgrounds before I got into frutiger aero / metro were not the best. </p>
<p class=bold>- What do you hope people take away from your art? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>I hope people take away a happy feeling with my art! I want people to smile when they see my art. </p>
<p class=bold>- Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>Not right now! My main goal right now is to hopefully pass my second year of college! </p>

I also have a Ko-fi if you would like to commission me! My Ko-fi username is megantrushell . </p>
<p class=bold>- If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who would it be and why? </p>

<p class=bold>- What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>I also love alternative fashion! I don’t have a necessary style, but I love anything black and pink! </p>
<p class=bold>- Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment? </p>
<p class=quotation-words>A big frutiger metro memory for me is listening to the clubland compilation albums as a kid, the covers for those is very ‘’ rave metro ‘’ I think! </p>
