            <br />

            <p>Here's our interview with Solinus:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hi! I’m Solinus, a designer and web developer that works in a
              variety of styles, but mainly Frutiger Aero. Whatever comes to my
              mind, I will design.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              In 2019, I started out by downloading different Google Slides
              themes from websites such as
              <a href="http://slidesgo.com/">slidesgo.com</a>, and the variety
              and design quality of those templates really appealed to me and
              made my presentations stand out. I loved combing through the
              layouts and configuring each graphic element to create an
              effective presentation. At one point, I even redesigned a Civil
              War presentation for my history teacher. In early 2021, I started
              out by redesigning a few of the school notices on the website by
              using Canva templates. Around March 2021, I noticed the
              “oversimplified logos” meme and realized the potential of an
              untapped market of people who prefer detailed and beautiful
              design, and the rest is history.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Around the same time I started creating ‘skeuomorphic’ designs, I
              joined a Discord server about skeuomorphism, where I learned about
              Frutiger Aero. At the time, it was still a very niche design style
              and considered a subgenre of skeuomorphism. I enjoyed the fusion
              of shiny glass and detailed icons combined with futuristic
              swishes, auroras, and nature elements.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It is very hard to say when I have a wide range of design styles,
              from flat and simple to dimension and gloss galore. My main style
              however as seen on
              <a href="https://solinus.neocities.org/">my website</a> involves
              earth tones and cozy visuals mixed with the shine and gloss of
              Frutiger Aero. For other projects, I think about how it’ll feel if
              it were to become a real life item, an example being a
              <a href="https://solinus.neocities.org/projects/2024/map.png"
                >game map HUD</a
              >
              I made in June of 2024.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I begin by looking up images that fit my overall concept and
              assembling them into a moodboard. I then create rough layouts with
              rectangles, sketches, and text boxes deciding where elements
              should be placed. Once I’m satisfied with the layout, I create the
              final version with proper spacing and detail, iterating and
              adjusting as I go along, until it looks just right.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I mainly use Figma due to its unparalleled versatility and speed
              for it being a free tool. Features such as auto layout, a type of
              group that evenly spaces out elements by a set amount—and styles,
              a palette that stores fills, text styles, and shadow/blur
              effects—speed up my design process heavily. However, Figma has its
              limitations and I hope to learn to integrate more tools in the
              near future such as Blender and Photoshop/Photopea.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I usually take a break from designing, and come back when I feel
              like it or when inspiration strikes me. I sometimes remake my old
              designs, using techniques I learned from experience.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I have a section at my
              <a href="https://solinus.neocities.org/links">links page</a>
              called “Galleries and Archives” containing links to many websites
              that showcase and archive many different designs, from
              <a href="https://cari.institute/">cari.institute</a> to the
              <a href="https://frutigeraeroarchive.org/"
                >Frutiger Aero Archive</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Besides well-known figures such as nitzukai, MondySpartan, and
              sonnie thoughts that have influenced my work,
              <a href="https://www.kylehalevi.com/">Kyle Halevi</a> is a
              professional UI designer that has worked with real companies. His
              design style is a more modern and subtle take on skeuomorphism.
              Whenever something feels ‘off’ in a design, I often contact him
              and discuss any design issues.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It gives my work a particular calm and refreshing feel that I
              enjoy. Due to its focus on gloss and lighting, it helps me in
              determining lighting and shadow in other, non-aero works.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The most challenging piece I ever made was my
              <a
                href="https://solinus.neocities.org//projects/2024/Frutiger%20Nouveau.png"
                >Art Nouveau x Frutiger Aero</a
              >
              mashup due to its flowy and curved style, as opposed to most UI
              design works with a rectangular layout. I also had to figure out
              how to combine two aesthetics that are a century apart, as Art
              Nouveau originated from the 1890s to the 1910s.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I am quite proud of my
              <a
                href="https://solinus.neocities.org/projects/2024/Aesthetics.png"
                >Aesthetic Eras</a
              >
              infographic because it shows just how wide my “design range” can
              be, covering 4 different design styles at once. Despite my bread
              and butter being Frutiger Aero, designing the Memphis section has
              been the most fun due to its varied textures and design.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The Frutiger Aero community led me to discover many different
              artists that influenced my design style and was the niche I was
              looking for when I began my design journey. It has also introduced
              me to several artists that shaped my design style into what it is
              today.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I hope that people, especially UI designers, see the value of
              beautiful and functional user interfaces. Like modern
              architecture, many UI designers believe that their designs must
              merely be functional with almost no regard for aesthetic appeal.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I have currently been commissioned to collaborate with a developer
              to create a ratings app. As this is still in the early stages at
              time of writing, I have yet to decide what direction this project
              would take.
            </p>

              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I was born on the day that Windows Vista was released for the
              public: January 30.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I remember digging out the old family computer with Windows Vista
              in the late 2010s to see if it can run, and messing around with
              it. It did work until around 2018 or 2019 when the graphics always
              glitched out after a few minutes of logging in.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Progress, inspiration, refinement.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Minimalism is key. Let the glass, lines, swooshes, and photography
              speak for themselves.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              While I haven’t been as involved in the Frutiger Aero community
              due to my wide range of design work, I’m still glad there is an
              audience that appreciates beautiful, glossy and dimensional
              graphics and user interfaces as was common in the 2000s and early
              2010s.
