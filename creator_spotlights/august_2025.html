            <p>Here's our interview with HarshnoiseMT:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hi! My name is Megan or HarshnoiseMT. I’m 18 years old and my
              biggest interests are frutiger metro and chiikawa. I love happy
              hardcore and dance music. I enjoy doing graphic design and
              character design related artwork.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’ve always been passionate about art since I was a child, so art
              has always been a big thing for me and I have always wanted to be
              an artist. I have many sketchbooks filled with art I have been
              making since I was really small.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I refound frutiger aero and metro through just scrolling through
              the internet but specifically frutiger metro stuck out to me the
              most. I think its because of all the bright colours usually used
              throughout, which make me very happy! Its also partially because
              of nostalgia too.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I would describe it as something that I would like to hope makes
              you feel happy!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I use pinterest as a lot of my inspiration, I take little bits
              from other pieces of frutiger metro artwork and make it into my
              own mash of shapes and colours
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I use digital most of the time because I guess it's just what I
              know best for my artwork
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I will put my headphones in and listen to a lot of happy hardcore
              , trance and eurodance music and open pinterest on my phone for
              some inspiration. I don’t really take long breaks from art as I am
              an art student!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My artwork is very heavily inspired by those frutiger metro images
              you would have seen on a notebook in 2012-2013. As for themes or
              emotions I would like to convey, I would just like to hope my art
              makes you happy!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Cody Vondell’s artwork really inspires me a lot, I love how clean
              and vibrant his work looks! The frutiger metro style has really
              influenced my art I really love the fun patterns and colours.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I think its the circle patterns, glossy orbs and floral patterns
              that make my art frutiger metro/aero.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Any piece I have done with glossy shapes that aren't circles are a
              pain to make, as I have to spend ages to make the gloss on the
              shapes not look warped!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              <a
                href="/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/august/harshnoisemt_1.png"
                title="Artwork 1"
                class="spotlight"
              >
                <img
                  src="/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/august/thumbnails/harshnoisemt_1.png"
                  alt="harshnoisemt' Artwork 1"
                  loading="lazy"
                />
              </a>

              I love this piece I made so much, I really love the detail I
              managed to pack into this piece! I also love the colour, pink is
              my favourite colour.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Its really helped me with background design a lot, as my
              backgrounds before I got into frutiger aero / metro were not the
              best.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I hope people take away a happy feeling with my art! I want people
              to smile when they see my art.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Not right now! My main goal right now is to hopefully pass my
              second year of college!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              You can find all of my artwork on reddit (<a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rottingbodiess/"
                >u/rottingbodiess</a
              >) and you can also find some of my artwork on tiktok ( m3gan.xoxo

              Ko-fi username is megantrushell .
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I would love to collaborate with Cody Vondell, his frutiger metro
              art is awesome!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I also love alternative fashion! I don’t have a necessary style,
              but I love anything black and pink!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              A big frutiger metro memory for me is listening to the clubland
              compilation albums as a kid, the covers for those is very ‘’ rave
              metro ‘’ I think!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">I , Can’t , Stop</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              When making frutiger metro art, the patterns will never be ‘’ too
              much ‘’.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              This community is awesome! Thank you so much for appreciating my
              art this much! Frutiger metro will never die!
            </p>
