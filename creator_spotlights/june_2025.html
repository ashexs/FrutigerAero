            <p>Here's our interview with Acaribun:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My name is acaribun online!! Iâ€™ve been drawing for junebe 7 years now, and I dabble in a bit of Frutiger metro/aero art but I mainly make anime art. Iâ€™m from Canada and I really like bunnies ^^
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I just started drawing as a hobby ever since I was in elementary for fun, and have been going since
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              From what I remember I found out about Frutiger Aero in 2022 via Youtube, I grew up using Windows 7 and found the Wii, 3DS, etc cool because of how glossy it looked
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              At least of the FA art Iâ€™ve made very bright, lots of gloss, crisp, bright
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I take note of anything that looks cool to me from media, then I get the motivation to draw and already have an idea in mind and honestly wing it till it looks good to me
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Digital since its more convenient and thereâ€™s just things that you canâ€™t do with traditional that I prefer. As for applications any FA art Iâ€™ve made used Ibis paint x
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Take a break from drawing for up to a month, drawing while burnt out is not something I can do well
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              None of the things I draw have ANY meaning but I hope people look at it and just think itâ€™s cool
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gogoro02/">@gogoro02</a> on instagram, Tite Kubo, are the two main artists I take inspiration from as well as Frutiger Aero, Metro, Emo art, and 2013 swag a LITTLE bit
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Making my art glossy is my favourite part, speakers, music notes, random shapes things like that
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece youâ€™ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I donâ€™t even think I named it but the â€˜frutiger metro artâ€™ one, since I had no idea what I wanted the finished product to look so I was just adding stuff and prayed that it looked good, thankfully it did
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece youâ€™re especially proud of and why itâ€™s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              â€˜frutiger metro artâ€™ part 1 and 2 because they were the first drawings I ever made that went like semi viral, I made the second one for an art show and it was apparently one of the best ones there which was cool. The both of them got saved by a lot of people and used on other platforms, one of them being twitter and the post got like 200k views!! I barely get credited though which wouldâ€™ve been nice ðŸ’”
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Led me to experimenting with putting FA elements into my art ^^
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I hope that people find it just cool to look at, so much so that they feel the need to make it their pfp or something that would be pretty cool
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals youâ€™re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I want to make more frutiger aero/metro art in the future as it has been a while
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I donâ€™t post as often as I used to but you can find me on Pinterest <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/acaribun/">@acaribun</a>
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Baron Ueda, his art is so cool I would love to work with him one day
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Whatâ€™s a fun fact about you that most people wouldnâ€™t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              One of my favourite games is Bejeweled 3!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Playing Art of Balance on my 3DS
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Iâ€™m Always Experimenting</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Always try your best, say no to AI!!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else youâ€™d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Iâ€™m honoured to be interviewed, thank you for having me!
