            <br />

            <p>Here's our interview with Aurio:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hi, I’m Aurio (also Waterstar on instagram). I am a British -
              Hungarian 3D and 2D artist and animator living in England.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I always had a very creative and chaotic mind and just had so many
              ideas so I decided one day to bring all my thoughts and feelings
              to life and now art and animation is my biggest hobby.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              When I was young, I grew up using Windows Vista, Windows 7 and iOS
              4. And then one day the whole UI style just magically disappeared
              from all my devices. I got really upset about this and eventually
              had extreme nostalgia from any sight of Windows Vista or old iOS.
              That's when in 2022 I discovered that my favourite UI design was
              an aesthetic that a whole group of people on the internet missed.
              That's when I decided to make many icons and characters based off
              of the frutiger aero aesthetic.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’d say in general it is very vibrant and eye-catching, maybe
              quite cartoony at times.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I first randomly generate a colour palette which helps me get an
              idea of what I want to draw, or I choose from the many art
              characters I own and draw one of them. I firstly do a rough
              sketch, while keeping it neat so I can clearly see what I’m
              drawing. Then I turn the opacity of the sketch down really low, to
              about 13% because it’s just a personal preference. Then I draw my
              outline on a vector layer using either a soft brush for painted
              works or an opaque pen for icons. I usually make the outer outline
              thicker than the outlines on the inside of the drawing where the
              colours will be, it gives it an appealing sticker effect. Then I
              erase overlapping lines to make sure the lines look sharp and
              tidy. This can be done easily on vector layers. Then I draw the
              colours with a hard pen brush, carefully making sure I don’t go
              over the outlines. After that, I render my work. I have many
              different ways of rendering but in my frutiger aero works, I
              choose where I want my light to be hitting. Then in a white,
              opaque pen, I draw the highlights and erase just a little bit
              underneath the highlights. Once I’ve done that, I use the eraser
              tool making sure it is sharp and the opacity is full. Then I erase
              certain areas of the highlights, mainly going for window or tree
              shapes. This gives it a reflection effect. Then it is finished.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              In my everyday works, I mainly use the default thick brush on clip
              studio paint because it has a sharp, yet hard appearance which is
              perfect for rendering and colouring. In my frutiger aero icons, I
              always use the airbrush or gradient tool to add depth to the art.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My art blocks last a very long time. But while I am currently
              having an art block, I just look at art from reddit and instagram
              until I get motivation and ideas about what I want to draw.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Nothing really inspires my work, I just use my imagination and
              maybe a few techniques from artists I’ve seen on the internet.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Again, I just use my imagination. But sometimes I like to base
              some of my work off of aesthetics that give me nostalgia, like
              frutiger aero and skeuomorphism.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The Frutiger aero aesthetic has inspired me to make very vibrant
              and shiny icons. I’ve learnt a lot from frutiger aero and it has
              significantly helped me with making more elements look more 3D.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My most challenging piece was a commission years ago of creating a
              whole 250 icons for someone’s computer. This put a lot of pressure
              on me because they gave me a month’s deadline to get it done.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              <a
                href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEZvwHIsvj6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="
                >This piece</a
              >
              is probably one of my favourites. I like it because it includes
              all my favourite elements of frutiger aero, the fish, the glass,
              the glossiness, and I turned it all into a silly cat that I now
              draw a lot because it is fun and satisfying.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Being part of the frutiger aero community has inspired me so much.
              Seeing so many wonderful and talented artists and designers for
              the aesthetic really made me happy. The community is very
              supportive and lively, always complimenting others’ art and
              cheering others up. It truly makes me want to continue what I love
              to do and make a lot more frutiger aero inspired art.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I hope people get a sense of inspiration and boldness from my art.
              I use vibrant colours to create energy and emotion, and I want to
              inspire others to never be afraid to try something new with their
              art.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My current project is making a large webcomic with a very intense
              storyline. I have been working on this for a good nine years but I
              choose to not give away any spoilers. The webcomic could possibly
              be published in 2030, though I’m still not quite sure.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’m very active on instagram! I have an account for my general
              art:
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aurio27.0/">@aurio27.0</a>
              and an account dedicated to my frutiger aero art:

                >@waterstar.district</a

            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Not quite sure about this one, probably any of the hundreds of
              artists I look up to.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I started drawing when I was 5 years old and animating when I was
              8 years old.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Definitely revisiting the Eden Project in Cornwall after 10 years.
              It always gave me strong frutiger aero vibes.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Painful, but fun</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Go for it! We need more frutiger aero artists in this world filled
              with flat design and minimalism.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I want to say a huge thank you to the frutiger aero community for
              all the support and kindness you have shared with me. Keep being
              awesome.
