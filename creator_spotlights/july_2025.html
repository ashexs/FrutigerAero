            <p>Here's our interview with Daniele63:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hello there! My name is Daniele, also known as Daniele63 online (but that number is really random). I was born at the turn of the millenium, when technology was present but not omnipresent. Since I was a kid, I loved playing video games and technology. I cannot count the hours I spent on the PS2, PS3, Wii, PSP, Xbox 360, DS, and Gameboy Advance. When I was little, I shared a Windows Vista laptop with my brother, and experienced the early days of YouTube, and old forums. When I got my own laptop, it had Windows 7 on it. I always loved the Aero design language and when I found out about Frutiger Aero, I instantly loved it because it evoked those memories. Last year I went on to make a website showcasing Frutiger Aero and other media from the 2000s/early 2010s time period, called Frutiger Aero Archive.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I've always been a creative person, drawing since I was a little kid, and enjoying games like LittleBigPlanet that gave you the freedom to make whatever you want and share it with others.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I first found it in 2024, initially stumbled upon the subreddit, forgot about it for a while and then a friend invited me to the Discord server and that's when I started to learn more about it (Shout out to you EnWelld if you read this).
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              For my "Stock Photo style" Frutiger Aero artworks, I tend to try to imitate the images that were made during that time period, I don't consider myself very good at it yet but I'm still learning the tools.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I usually look at an already-made image and try to do something similar with different assets and my own spin to it.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              For Frutiger Aero art, I use Photoshop, but I also like to do stuff hand-drawn sometimes. 
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I don't force myself to make anything unless I have a clear idea in mind. If I can't come up with anything, taking a break does the trick usually.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
             My work is inspired by the stock imagery that was made in the early 2000s up to early 2010s, mainly the ones made by Asadal and the Sozaijiten. For emotions, I try to convey optimism and joy.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The numerous artists on the Discord and Subreddit have inspired me. Outside of that, it's just my own style.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic portrays an optimistic view of the future, where nature and technology co-exist in harmony. I try to capture that in my artworks.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I don't have any in mind at the moment, but I would say the most challenging part for me is getting the shadows right, and finding high-resolution assets. I still need to improve in both of these aspects.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I like <a href="https://frutigeraeroarchive.org/images/wallpapers/daniele/daniele_13.jpg">this piece</a> because it reminds me of some old fantasy wallpapers for some reason.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Not only artistically, it changed my life for the better. I've made a lot of friends in the Discord server and my website has seen insane traffic, around 3 million views as I write this, I still can not wrap my mind around it. Overall it has made me discover digital art which I was not at all interest in previously.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I mostly just do these for fun but I hope some people use them as their wallpapers.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Not at the moment.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              You can find me on my <a href="https://frutigeraeroarchive.org">website</a>. If you want to support me financially, I have a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/E1E818B7E7">Ko-fi page</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Maybe with Solinus, making the community website with his design was really fun, and I love his designs. MondySpartan's concept UIs are also great.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I love Anime and Vocaloid, and I have Autism and ADHD. I also own multiple Terrariums and I love Isopods.            
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Everytime I booted Windows 7 and hearing the startup sound (In fact, I still have it enabled on my Windows 10 PC).</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Adapt, Improve, Overcome</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Don't hesitate asking for help on our community Discord or subreddit, also, don't let criticism get to you but use it as a way to improve your art.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Y'all are some of the best people I've met in my life and I love the enthusiasm of everyone. I'm glad we can find some peace and fun in those little things and forget about our problems for a while.
            </p>
