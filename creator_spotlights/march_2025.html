            </p>
            <br />

            <p>Here's our interview with MondySpartan:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hi, I'm MondySpartan! I'm an Indonesian artist who likes to do
              operating system/software mockups.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Back in my childhood I used to do a lot of fake Windows desktops
              in PowerPoint, Paint, and even drawing them on books. So it's safe
              to say the enthusiasm of Windows, computers and their aesthetics
              that I have been having almost the entirety of my life are what
              plays the major part of bringing me here. It faded away though for
              some time, however sometime in early 2020s, I came across this
              cool looking concept showing
              <a
                href="https://www.deviantart.com/pepverbsnouns/art/Windows-NT-10-0-Mockup-Icon-Artwork-DL-827984828"
                >Windows 10 reimagined with aesthetics of Windows 9x and 2000</a
              >. That was when my interest in doing OS/software mockups started
              to return in full force, and still to this day.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Back in 2022, one of my friends linked me to a video about "that
              one aesthetic you may have forgotten", which was about Frutiger
              Aero. When I saw it, I realized that it was that kind of aesthetic
              I used to see everywhere, mostly on the user interface of
              computers and other electronics. I grew up using Windows XP, Vista
              (through my dad's laptop), Windows 7, OS X Lion, iOS 4-6 and the
              NXE-era Xbox 360. Except for the first one (mostly), they are all
              examples of the Frutiger Aero aesthetic. My first impression was
              just "oh, this is cool", but later when I started experimenting
              with glosses and orbs, researching user interfaces of the era, I
              realized the potential this and skeuomorphism had, and how they
              made user interfaces seem more true-to-life back then.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Majority of my designs can be summed into this sentence: take back
              what's in the present to the past. While how they look can vary
              between creations, the one thing that’s constant is nostalgia,
              ones that can be likely to make a person or two get the feels.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I actually don't have a constant way of doing artworks, but when
              some cool idea just shows up in my head, then I usually do it
              almost immediately. At the end it's all about letting my
              imagination run wild and some if not most experimenting.
              <br />For reference stuff I just use mostly Google Images. In
              order to broaden up the reference images exclusively to the era
              I'm targeting, I usually use "before:year" (without quotes) after
              a keyword; so for example, if I'm going to look for something
              related to the Aero design interface, I would add "before:2009"
              after what I'm searching so that I would only get images straight
              from the Vista era.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I use Figma for almost everything. Figma has proven to me as an
              easy design tool that only gets easier and fun the more I discover
              something new about it. For some stuff like aliased text and
              16-bit icons in 90s-era concepts though, I use
              <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a>, Aseprite and/or
              Photoshop.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It's kind of a difficult question since I have been mostly in it
              these days, but that doesn't mean I'll be forever in this
              position. What I can try is to probably look up for screenshots
              and stuff from various eras, look at other's works or concepts, or
              even experiment with things.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Some inspirations may come from sources such as DeviantArt,
              concepts posted on Discord servers and Twitter/Bluesky, but most
              are a result of my creative thinking, and the ideas that just show
              up like a lightbulb.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              When it comes to anything that has influenced me, there's probably
              a lot of them, but artists like
              <a href="https://x.com/xtracore_04/">Xtracore</a>,
              <a href="https://x.com/nitzukai/">nitzukai</a>,
              <a href="https://x.com/luciascarlet">LuciaScarlet</a>, and
              <a href="https://x.com/1000kilobytes">Kilobyte</a> are among my
              influences. While we're here, I would also love to give a shoutout
              to my two best friends: <br />ChaosReactor/Angel, and
              <a href="https://x.com/bfdia6ispeak/">Rhapsody2612/Alyssa</a>!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Frutiger Aero stepped up my designing game in several ways. It
              even made me experiment and figure out how to do true-to-life
              skeuomorphic icons.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’m not sure which one. I guess it’s due to how each work I did,
              especially the ones involving FA, are not without any challenges,
              but these challenges are fun to be tackled with.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I may say I enjoy every piece of art that I made, but there’s this
              one concept that stands out from the rest. Sometime in January
              2023, a good few days before my birthday, I presented a concept to
              a subreddit showing how Discord would have looked like if it
              existed in 2005. The response and feedback were quite positive,
              but what I did not expect was the creation going places,
              eventually reaching a popular Twitter account tweeting computer
              aesthetics, where it gained a large amount of popularity.

              <br />I clarified myself as the original creator at the tweet, and
              the rest would turn out to be history. While it’s not Aero
              related, it definitely paved the way for me to make more similar
              concept designs, experimenting with stuff, and in its process,
              discovering this aesthetic known as Frutiger Aero.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The Frutiger Aero community has truly influenced my artistic
              journey in many ways. Not only have I met and made new friends
              there, but I'm also able to improve my art by getting inspired by
              many works of talented people there.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I hope a lot of people can be inspired by what I create, and
              hopefully also proven that design with soul still lives on.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Right now, I am currently assigned to a large-scale project,
              which, due to the fact it’s under a signed NDA, is something I
              cannot talk about past this point. But it’s related to my
              designing hobby, which is cool.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I can be reached at
              <a href="https://x.com/tehmondspartan">Twitter</a> and
              <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mondyspartan.bsky.social"
                >Bluesky</a
              >. I have a
              <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mondyspartan">DeviantArt</a>,
              though I've rarely posted there. You can also reach my Discord,
              exact same name.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’m not really sure about this one, but probably any of my
              influences!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Everyone’s first drawing at school was either a house or hills.
              One of my first was the hills. But the one with a Recycle Bin. And
              a taskbar. No, seriously.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I had the good pleasure of visiting the Selfridges Building in
              Birmingham, UK a few years ago, where its exterior was featured as
              one of the wallpapers of Windows 7.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">My own comfort.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It is your mission to reignite the soul in design and put Frutiger
              Aero back in the limelight as the standard.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’m way beyond grateful to be part of something, this community. I
              also appreciate every one of you who have supported my work over
              the past few years. You all have proven to me that Frutiger Aero
              is, in fact, far from the dead. Thank you so much.
