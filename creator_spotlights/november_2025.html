            <p>This month, our Artist of the Month is Ali!</p>

            <p>
              YouTube short coming soon... In the mean time, watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_NzsSK86Urs">previous one</a>!
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>Here's our interview with Ali:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My name is Ali, I also go by Lee, I’m a 20 year old cashier from Minnesota. I grew up creating a lot of art, don’t do too much now since I’m                employed but I still write a little music and of course help out with assets for our <a href="https://discord.gg/frutigeraero">server</a> ^_^
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I was really into cartoons and video games and all sorts of media with very interesting character designs, along with being part of an                      artistic family. That all pushed me to start illustrating from a very young age. The design skills came in later, lol.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              When I was like 17 I came across a youtuber by the name of “undefined” (I’m sure a lot of you also found out about FA through this) and they                had a youtube video on FA. I had recognized the images but I wasn’t sure what it was called, so I clicked out of curiosity. Nowadays I think                there’s some things that could have improved the video however it was a great jumping off point for me.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My typical art style is very rough around the edges with thick lineart and typically no color at all. My FA art is, obviously, very                         different, being very soft and glowy and serene. I love being able to have many styles to create all sorts of different things ^_^
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              For one of my icons, I start with a base PSD I have from the original icon I made for the server. From there, I think about the theme I’m                   trying to convey, and then I use google searches specific to the era to find FA styled backgrounds that could match. I’ll usually look up                   things like “orange vector wallpaper before:2014”. If I need assets like a hat, or a wine glass, or flowers, I’ll usually try to make it                    myself, but I use and edit clip art in place of self-made assets if I don’t have time (which is typical). At the end of it, I always go over                any assets and flat images still in the icon with gradient maps to make sure things really pop.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I use photopea for editing and procreate for drawing. They’re literally just what I’ve been using for a decade so I don’t want to learn                     anything new lol.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I just don’t create when I’m blocked and move on to something else. A lot of the time when I have a “block”, my mind is burnt out from the                  other stressors in life. In moments like those, I just take any creative urges out in the Sims and when i feel like drawing again I do.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I just go with the vibe for the day. If I’m feeling like designing a little character, I do that. If I’m feeling like doing some editing,                   I’ll do that.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I take a lot of inspiration from Chris Prynoski and Jim Mahfood in my typical illustrations. My FA illustrations I would say are just                       influenced by the aesthetic and my own personal preferences for how they should look.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It’s everything when I’m working on assets!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>
              <a
                href="/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/november/ali_7.png"
                title="Frutiger Aero Discord Icon"
                class="spotlight"
              >
                <img
                  src="/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/november/thumbnails/ali_7.png"

                  loading="lazy"
                />
              </a>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Probably the first refurbished FA icon after my initial set of custom icons. I had to play around with it for so long to figure out how to                  make it look how I wanted it to.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">            
              I’m proud of all my pieces ^_^
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It’s made me expand my artistic abilities and I basically learned an entire new style of doing things from working with this aesthetic.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Whatever they want to. The meaning is up to interpretation.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Slowly chipping away at making some music and hoping eventually I can write a comic book. Very far out ideas because of time, but                           artistically, those are my future goals.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’m on discord and twitter <a href="https://x.com/dopeboyoccultst">@dopeboyoccultist</a> though I don’t post much art. Only worth a follow if               you like rambling and Sematary.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Probably Bjork that would be lit.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The summer of 8th grade I bleached my hair and dyed it hot pink.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Joining the OG r/frutigeraero server and spending many a lonely night talking about technology on there <3 I’ll always have love for the day                1s.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Convoluted, messy, beautiful.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Just learn that damn program and make your art! Time waits for nobody.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I love you guys and though I haven’t been super active since I got a job, I check on y’all constantly and I will until either I or the                      community explodes. Thank you for your time if you read all this! ^_^
