            <p>Here's our interview with Kilobyte:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
             Hello!!!! I'm kilobyte, and I'm a 16 year old graphic designer and artist from California. I’m a junior in high school, and I enjoy making pretty UI designs, and pretty much everything graphic design. I love technology and my interests are weather, object shows (BFDI, Inanimate Insanity, animated shows like that), Frutiger Aero and old UI styles like skeuomorphism, aviation + transportation, and gaming. Did you know I’m also a furry?
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              When I was a child, I was always obsessed with drawing and I would draw art or draw UIs. When I went to school I’d always draw on the whiteboards and I even had my parents buy me a small whiteboard so that I could draw with my colorful dry-erase markers at home. I was able to recreate UI designs, and logos on the whiteboards at such an early age.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I discovered Frutiger Aero around 2022, I believe, and I didn’t know there was a whole dedicated community for these kinds of art. It’s really cool and I like seeing it since I get very happy to see people talk about how great Frutiger Aero is.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I like to describe my art style as almost soft, bubbly, and candy-like. It’s very fun and bright, and it’s something that I want others to be inspired by.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I sometimes think of my ideas randomly and then design it from how I imagined it, and sometimes I storyboard my ideas on paper and then I design it out.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I preferably like to use a Mac to design, and an iPad to do actual art. Windows and Linux feel a bit limiting to me when I do UI design, and I use Sketch to design UIs. I love how fast and efficient my M1 MacBook Air is. I don’t like using Figma anymore, but I use it anyways alongside Sketch since it lacks some features that Figma doesn't have, for example, patterns and applying distortion and texture effects to vectors.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I just try to think of an idea that nobody has ever thought of, and I will mostly take small breaks like playing Roblox or something else. I also make a moodboard of other people’s work to get inspired.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I want my work to have this calm, fun, and playful mood.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My style’s heavily inspired and influenced by MondySpartan, Lucia Scarlet, nitzukai, SectorWire, and aidak. They all make great art.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
             It plays really well when it comes to Windows UI concepts, and Apple’s Liquid Glass. I recently made an iOS “better”  Liquid Glass concept, where the UI has more depth and a more glossy-ish look, which I think has some "frutiger aero-ness” in it.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The most challenging piece I’ve probably created was the Windows Arise concept/mockup. I wanted to make it because I wondered what would’ve happened if Microsoft continued to use Aero, but refined it for modern times like today.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">            
              I’m really proud of making that Cortana but Aero UI concept. It shows how much I improved in design, but that was made at the start of the year. I sadly don’t have the file for this design anymore because of some computer troubles I had.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It influenced me well, and it actually made me learn how to properly make “aeroy” things better.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Anything. I don’t really think about it when I do art.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I want to try and learn Blender, and I want to go back to video editing and maybe do a video project.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              People can find me on Twitter, Roblox, Discord, and YouTube. I rarely use Threads, TikTok, and Bluesky. I go by 1000kilobytes on <a href="https://x.com/1000kilobytes">Twitter</a> and 1000bytes on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/1000bytes.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>. My Roblox is <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/2900279683/profile">KernelExtension</a> and my Discord is 1000bytes. My YouTube is also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@1000bytes">1000bytes</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’d collaborate with MondySpartan or Lucia Scarlet, because they’re so cool!!! I LOVE THEIR UI DESIGNS so much!!!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I was born a day after Mac OS X Snow Leopard released to the public.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My favorite Frutiger Aero moment was when I was a child and I used Windows Vista on my sister's big bulky laptop. It was capable of running Aero and it was so pretty. I vividly remember changing the window transparency and color and being so fascinated by it.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Renaissance, unique, home. My own art makes me feel at home.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Always listen to feedback! It’s what makes you improve in art.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’m so glad to see that this community is growing. It makes me happy, knowing that there are still people who like Frutiger Aero, and I’m glad to share this with all of you here.
            </p>
