            <p>Here's our interview with ElijahQ2010:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My name is Elijah, I’m a 15 years old male, and a sophomore in
              high school.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’ve been inspired to become an artist/graphic designer ever since
              I’ve discovered the Frutiger Aero aesthetic for the first time.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’ve first discovered Frutiger Aero from a compilation on YouTube
              in March 2024, and what drew me to it is that it represents a
              hopeful vision of the future that people experienced during their
              childhood or early adulthood in the 2000s, and early 2010s.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I would describe my art style as futuristic freestyle.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’m a go with the flow type person when it comes to graphic
              designing.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I use stock images, and Canva to create my artwork.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Despite having creative blocks, I try to keep going, even if I’m
              not confident in hopes the final product is good.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My designs convey feelings of nostalgia, hope, and comfort.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My inspirations are old technology, and user interface aesthetic.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The Frutiger Aero aesthetic is present in all of my designs from
              vibrant colors, realistic, and glossy textures.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              If I’m being honest, making my artwork is challenging part, it’s
              hard to be unique sometimes.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              <a
                href="/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/september/elijahQ2010_1.png"
                title="Artwork 1"

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I have hard time answering that question since I’m still new to
              art and graphic design. I would hope though that people will
              appreciate my designs, and come up with their own interpretations
              of it.
