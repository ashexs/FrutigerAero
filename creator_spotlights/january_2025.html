              community. We will be featuring a new Frutiger Aero Artist of the
              Month starting in 2025.

            <p>Here's our interview with Liam:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hi! I’m Liam; I design basically anything from icons to wallpapers
              to 3D models or even asset packs for fellow designers! I just love
              making things beautiful.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              As far back as I can remember I was interested in the arts, be it
              awful illustrations or having friends in acting or film, it’s
              always been in my life. I honestly cannot remember what
              specifically got me into design, but I do know that having really
              supportive friends and surrounding myself with other artists
              really strengthened my passion and skillset and really helped me
              get going and fuelled my fire.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I grew up with our family computer running Windows XP, and once it
              was released, 7 for the majority of my memorable childhood, so I
              was very familiar with the style from having firsthand experience
              of the Aero theme itself, and just generally the world having that
              ‘Frutiger Aero’ design style style in most forms of media in the
              first half of the 2010s. The Windows Aero theme was one of the
              first forms of design that ever stuck out to me as a kid. I
              absolutely loved it and felt a personal connection to it, be it
              from the memories I had made or just the pure iconic look and
              charm the OS had. Once Aero was axed, I had constantly been
              looking around for a genre that summarised the wide range of
              beautiful styles that were in design from that period growing up,
              so once the term “Frutiger Aero” was coined and widely recognised,
              I was quite happy to see so many people appreciating a style that
              I thought went unrecognised.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Maximalist. Not one pixel left untouched.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’d say most of my best work was done “locked in.” I typically
              would have been looking for and collecting art following a certain
              specific style and I’ll usually start by looking at specific
              structures in these designs and figuring out how they were made,
              the process is typically going through quite a few old links on
              the internet and hopes of internet archive snapshots saving
              resources from designers sharing their techniques on how they made
              their graphics, however alot of the time there wont really be any
              resources, so I’ll just try and figure stuff out myself, this
              sometimes takes a while but is worth it, and once youve learned
              something once, usually it sticks! So really its quite fast, and
              really you dont need to do it unless youre trying a completely new
              style or subgenre. I’ll then start with the actual piece,
              sometimes these can reuse assets from the practice process,
              sometimes they can be completely original compositions, it all
              just depends on where my mind is. For my aero wallpapers, there
              isnt too much planning to how the composition will look, its all
              really in the technique and positioning of elements and how they
              blend into each-other, it’s very experimental and detail oriented
              :P
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I use your standard tools, usually Adobe Photoshop, and
              Illustrator for my graphics. Any motion is done in After Effects.
              Although I do look to widen my arsenal and try out tools like
              Figma some time soon, I hope to try out UI Design sometime :-)

              <br />For texturing, archived royalty free stock image CDs tend to
              be what I use, they’re convenient and come in batches for each
              texture, so you can really curate the look you want. TextureLabs
              is also another great free resource for overlays and textures.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Haha, it’s very odd. I’m quite the workaholic so I tend to just
              try and focus on a different area of design, so if i’m blocked on
              wallpapers, I’ll try some iconography, or messing with 3D scenes.
              If that doesnt work or doesnt feel interesting, I’ll usually just
              spend my time either looking through the depths of old art sites
              for inspiration, or talking to my fellow designer friends and
              seeing what theyre up to and seeing if theres anything that could
              spark an idea in me. It’s great to network and talk to your
              friends on stuff like this and share stuff, even if you think you
              arent getting somewhere its good to get feedback from friends as
              they could have the one piece youre missing to remove that block.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              there’s ALOT that inspires me, There’s too many specific pieces
              for me to name, but alot of my inspiration can come from sources
              like DeviantArt, <a href="https://www.are.na/">are.na</a>, Windows
              Wallpaper Wiki, and even old stock image CD ROMS.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Plenty! I have brilliant friends that I look up to heavily and get
              feedback from like Nitzukai, Kilobyte, and Underscor3. There are
              also plenty of artists and movements which generally inspire me
              and make brillient stuff, like MondySpartan, DesktopGeneration,
              Syndromatic, The IconFactory, The Designers Republic. I could go
              on for days haha
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              It’s difficult to say! One piece that I’m really proud of is a
              piece I did recently called “<a
                href="https://x.com/z2rMC/status/1866917879234650461"
                >Touch the Sky.</a
              >” I feel like it combines quite a few of my prior styles into one
              punchy, cohesive piece. I’m quite proud of it and would like to do
              more in the same style some time!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I think it really opened my eyes to abstraction in art and being
              around in the community has lead me to find a delightful network
              of friends who do very similar designs and have really great
              feedback to give and techniques to shar, theyre also of course
              brilliant friends too, always great chats. I’d say 70% of my
              online friends right now have been people I have found through
              chain connections in this community, and I’m very grateful for
              that.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              With my wallpapers, I hope they’re seen as desktop wallpapers
              first, art exhibits second. It's intended to blend in with the
              desktop environment and only once you look at the image in
              specific as opposed to the desktop would it be evident the effort
              that has been put into it and the beauty of the piece. I really
              hope people just enjoy the work and have pride in using it to
              represent their workstation. It makes me really happy to see so
              many people appreciate my stuff and its really all I could ever
              ask for!!!!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My Twitter is where I post my art consistently! You can find me at
              <a href="https://twitter.com/z2rmc">https://twitter.com/z2rmc</a>
              If you want to support me, you can do so easiest via Ko-Fi, which
              can be found here:
              <a href="https://ko-fi.com/liamz2r">https://ko-fi.com/liamz2r</a>
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The games bundled with Windows 7 make me feel emotions I cannot
              describe, They remind me of being little and having fun with my
              family with this new tech. It really did feel futuristic at the
              time with all the sound effects and animations. Hell, even chess
              was really cool to me solely because of it being 3D and pretty, I
              didnt (and still dont) know how to play chess!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Corner to Corner.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Make friends and follow your heart. You cannot go wrong if you’re
              led by your heart and have your friends watching your back. Things
              take time and they shouldn’t be rushed but you should share your
              journey as you go and try to better yourself at each point of the
              way.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I would just like to say thank you all for the continued love and
              support I’ve had ever since the start. I feel really honoured to
              be in the position I am today and to have the amount of
              appreciation I do. It really keeps me going and gives me pride.
            </p>
