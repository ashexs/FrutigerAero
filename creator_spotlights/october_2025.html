            <br />

            <p>Here's our interview with Iyayne:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hey, I’m Ian. My username is basically just a name created by adding unnecessary Y and an E at the end when I first made my geometry dash 									account. I’m a young artist that adores many medias, such as arts, music and litterature. I am currently a student willing to get that sweet 								sweet computer graphics DEP. I'm also a huge retro collector, this includes old phones, consoles and optical media as well as media centers. 								I will usually share in the both the subreddit and the discord my creations, findings, old tech discussions and well… reaction images
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’d say I kinda just became one, my mother showed me that my first drawing was a bunch of colorful scribbles, and that I just kept going that 							way, I would keep looking at episodes on my tv from either cartoon network, nickelodeon or tele-quebec and try to recreate each art-style or 								character, then it developed, I would show to others until i reached to a point both me and my brother received a free tablet my mom had 										received from the bank as a bonus and thats when i discovered a lot of… undertale art, being the innocent kid I was I simply kept looking up 								tutorials on how to draw undertale characters! And my skills kept growing (and my love for undertale, I basically forgot about it.) and soon 								discovered about magma, a free online drawing platform with tons of people that I could practice with, show my works and improve, and that's 								where I am today!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My past of course! The gaming nights with my wii U, the 3ds I cherished all those years… playing zenses on my mom’s ds lite, my psvita and 									psp (rip) my wii I absolutely loved playing wii play on with my brother (wii tanks tops!) the ipod touch 1st gen I had, playing office jerk 								on my grandpa’s ipad 1 and using windows 7 at school to do presentations (or creating fake pokémon cards for my friends) are all part of the 								nostalgic stuff I had with frutiger aero, also not forgetting were I was living too! Montréal is one of these places that on the outside, 									it's a brutalistic minimalist architectural nightmare, but on the inside and where I went with my parents to either check out their jobs or 								go buy some playmobils were aero heaven!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I’d describe it as a more standard Realistic artstyle that is looking to get more detailed as it goes. I target realism in the anatomy, 										however my heads are a bit more on the simpler side, keeping a clear recognition of emotion. However my figures show complexity and more 										poses targeted, I put more effort into finding a nice and powerful pose for my characters than nailing the anatomy.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              An idea is simple, I usually mind my own business, looking for something to do and it usually appears about now, when my brain gives up 										trying to do something and creates something, then I simply go to my computer and start doodling/sketching what im looking for. I can look 									for inspiration online or sometimes I'll draw with friends on magma! Ill add colors, backgrounds and shading and post it wherever I want it 								to be.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I use my computer, which also works as a tablet with a pencil inside, it was my school computer back in 2021 - 2023 and was given to me after 							my horrible 2 years at that school (I will not mention the name of the school but they charged me 1.5k for a 200$ computer), which I 												installed linux mint on and draw on either krita or magma, I also both have a notebook to draw in with my professional pencils and a tower pc 							I use to create 3d renders, games and etc.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Simple, take some time off, play some games, listen to music and then come back to your work and it appears like nothing happened!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Many many many medias inspires my work, for once, Jet Set Radio (Future) is a major part of my artistic progress, which is what made me learn 							about poses, characteristics and emotions, JoJo’s bizarre adventure made me learn about anatomy and how important each detail is, the little 								tail bronx series made me learn about creativity, and how far it can go and how different a style, time and space each art can be.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hideki Naganuma, Composer of both JSR and JSRF as well as some tunes in BRC has made a huge impact on my art, as well as Hirohiko Araki, 										Mangaka of the Jojoba series, Aquasine and Metaroom who helped me in my debuts and Toby Fox, which in fact, started most of my absolute 										obsession over arts.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What role does the Frutiger Aero aesthetic play in your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              They play the skeuomorphism part, the reason why I keep adding details, why I don't want to make it look so simplistic and boring, the reason 							why most of my stuff has gloss and why I’m creating this.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Entire games: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/134039739432734/The-Lore-Accurate-Backrooms">The Lore Accurate Backrooms</a>, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/77222741634755/Negation-A-lost-backrooms-media">Negation</a>.
							They are probably some of the hardest things I could think of, each detail in the builds, block by block placing, rotation, uniting, grouping 							all for stuff like this to be born.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              <a
                href="/images/blogposts/creator_spotlights/october/iyayne_7.png"
                title="Solatorobo Music Cover Art"
                class="spotlight"

                  loading="lazy"
                />
              </a>

              This was a piece I had made for a friend for his music covers on the game Solatorobo, I had made him this to payback when he made tunes for 								me and it's still one of my most detailed artworks to this day.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How has being part of the Frutiger Aero community influenced
              your artistic journey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              By joining this community, It made me feel like I needed to show my support by creating frutiger related artworks and sharing them amongst 									all, by spreading either the nostalgia I had of what others thought of this style.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              That every goal can be within the touch of your hands if you are willing to try.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I'm currently creating stickers of my favorite video game characters, drawing each and every one of them one by one, with as much detail as 								possible to share and show other people so if they also want to, print them as they please. Im also really working hard for that DEP in 										Computer Graphics.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hideki Naganuma for sure, being able to either create an animation or cover art for some of his songs would absolutely be an experience! 										Being able to do what I’ve been thinking it’d be so impactful for me.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I used to do competitive rock climbing, I can dislocate my thumb casually, I can speak with throat vibrations!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Setting up the wii U with my dad, the music, the look of the settings and how nice looking it was, the sunny time outside and my dad working 								out how to set it up was truly a moment I remember vividly
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The Frutiger aero community really helped me meet new people I never would've thought I’d see. Many of the friends I have come from this 										<a href="https://discord.gg/frutigeraero">server</a> and we've kept building our friendships from it since.
