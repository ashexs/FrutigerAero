            <p>Here's our interview with Ghourical:</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your
              background?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Hello! My name is Elyssa, known as Ghourical on the internet. I am
              currently 18 years old attending university for Mechanical
              Engineering. I enjoy 3D modelling, 3D printing and bringing
              miscellaneous concepts to life using the power of technology.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- What inspired you to become an artist?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I was inspired to become an artist when looking at early 2000s
              video games, such as Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 64. I
              loved the trophies and objects in the game, and often wished to
              possess them in real life. It was also the appeal of certain
              visuals and aesthetics created by games, especially the presence
              of Nintendo during the prime of Frutiger Aero. I started to 3D
              model and create 3D art based off of these video games and my
              favorite aesthetic Frutiger Aero!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - How did you first discover Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic, and
              what drew you to it?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I first discovered Frutiger Aero as an aesthetic simply by living
              in it. I was around six years old during the prime of Frutiger
              Aero in the early 2010s, and had access to the internet as a
              child. The goldfish Softsoap containers, the clunky Windows 7, the
              Wii, the vivid imagery of the sky, the random generated backdrops
              of Windows 7 screensavers, Samsung Advertisements from Asia (I
              loved watching those!). When I rediscovered Frutiger Aero, it
              IMMEDIATELY resonated with me once I saw a few pictures, and
              unlocked a feeling of nostalgia for me. A feeling of nostalgia I
              had been looking for a long time.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How would you describe your art style?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I describe my art style as calm and serene, typically made to make
              your mind reference moments of vivid Furtiger Aero nostalgia. My
              work is meant to make your mind turn blank, or really reflect on
              past experiences during your lifetime.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you walk us through your creative process from idea to
              finished piece?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Most of my art pieces are created through Blender, a free
              multiplatform app for 3D modelling, rendering, simulation, etc. I
              usually create something original, or recreate an aesthetic, scene
              or object from a video game or piece of media from the 2000s. If I
              want to just create a visual, I go through a process of adding
              materials and rendering through layers in the software, or I
              prepare the 3D models for 3D printing in a slicer software.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What tools or mediums do you prefer to use, and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I prefer to use Blender or a computer software to make my artwork,
              I’ve never been good at drawing and I like to bring my creations
              to life by 3D printing them!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">- How do you overcome creative blocks?</p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I overcome creative blocks by just sitting at my computer and
              opening up the software to model. I look at Pinterest, asset
              libraries, or even in the Frutiger Aero Discord to check out some
              other inspirations in my work.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What inspires your work? Are there specific themes, emotions, or
              stories you aim to convey?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              What inspired my work is evoking thoughts/feelings out of another
              human. I aim to convey the peace and clarity that Frutiger Aero
              delivers when we are in need of finding calmness. When I create
              Frutiger Aero art, I try to convey key aspects of a few aesthetics
              from Frutiger Aero: glacier, water, and futuristic.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Are there any artists, aesthetics, or movements that have
              influenced your style?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Staysie Atoms, Hung-Tung Lu, and the presence of technology and
              media in the early 2000s has influenced my style tremendously.
              Especially the UI layout of Nintendo gaming systems in the early
              2000s, such as the Wii, DS & 3DS.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What has been the most challenging piece you’ve created, and
              why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              The most challenging piece I’ve created were miniature trophies
              from the Special Cup of Mario Kart Wii. It was my first time
              getting the chance to operate my resin printer, so I had a lot of
              mechanical issues.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Can you share a piece you’re especially proud of and why it’s
              significant to you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              A piece I'm proud of and why it's significant to me is the
              Frutiger Aero Dessert Plate. It has most of the components or
              notable visuals from frutiger aero all in one place, which is one
              of the aspects I strived for it to have.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What do you hope people take away from your art?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I hope people come to an understanding of my appreciation for
              Frutiger Aero art, and how my art can make others feel.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have any upcoming projects or goals you’re excited about?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Not as of recently, as I am in college for Mechanical Engineering.
              As of right now, it’s taking up most of my time!
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Where can people find more of your work or support you?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I do have a Tik Tok i'm not really active on. My user is 3dghour
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who
              would it be and why?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              I would LOVEEE to collaborate with Hung Tung-Lu. He is one of the
              few artists that get the least recognition for contributing to
              Frutiger Aero art when it comes to China. We saw the most
              emergence of Frutiger Aero from places such as Taiwan, and Japan,
              but not nearly the same amount of the aesthetic coming from many
              Chinese advertisements or social media back then, so Hung Tung-Lu
              was a great inspiration for me when creating 3-D Frutiger Aero
              art.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What’s a fun fact about you that most people wouldn’t know?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              A fun fact about me that most people wouldn’t know is that I am
              obsessed with humanoid robotics.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Do you have a favorite Frutiger Aero memory or moment?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              My favorite Frutiger Aero moment/memory is from a Youtube
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ozXwgGFr7k">video</a> by
              a channel named ArpWire TV. They uploaded a Zen/Vaporwave Frutiger
              Aero visual/playlist that is to absolutely adore. My favorite part
              is the opening, where a man is sitting down in a chair that
              subsides into an ocean view as he continues to read.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - If you could describe your artistic journey in three words, what
              would they be?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Fearless, serene, unreal.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              - What advice would you give to aspiring artists who are inspired
              by Frutiger Aero?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">
              Be creative within your own means, not anyone else's. I get teased
              all the time by peers for my commitment to this art style.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              - Is there anything else you’d like to share with the Frutiger
              Aero community?
            </p>

            <p class="quotation-words">Flourish and be great :)</p>
